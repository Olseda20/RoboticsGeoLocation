# RoboticsGeoLocation
Robotics Geolocation Project

This is an mini project to demonstrate my ability to generate a Turtle Robot that can autonomously make it's way to a given location.


### SETUP
### Part 1: Create some code for turtle to be able to directly move to the a given location.
- Get initial tutle onto a map
- Get initial rotation, trajectory and distance abiliy from current location to coordinate location
- introduce mapping functionality? google maps api??

### Step 1: Spin up a new docker container
#### Spinning up a Docker container for core noetic build
In your terminal set up a docker instance for the project. in this case the name of the project is `rosproject`
```bash
docker pull ros
docker run -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 --name rosproject -it ros:noetic-ros-core bash
```

#### Accessing docker container
```
docker exec -it rosproject bash
```   
- note: if you're outside of your continer, to display the available docker containers on a new terminal run `docker ps -l`
```bash
(base) omro@Omars-MacBook-Pro-6 ~ % docker ps -l
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
1fc98c8ed6cc   ros:noetic-ros-core   "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes             rosproject
```

#### Run the first time setup
Once you're inside the docker continer, run the `first-time-setup.sh` bash script to install all the relevant depancies  for the project.
```bash
./first-time-setup.sh
```

### Testing the Work
1- To ensure the Position and Motion methdos are appropriately working run the Provided tests ensuring they all pass.
  on a new terminal window that is currently accessing the docker container run the 2 provided tests.
Position Tests
```
pytest PositionTests.py
```
Motion Tests
```
pytest MotionTests.py
```


1- In a new terminal tab, start up roscore
