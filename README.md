# RoboticsGeoLocation
Robotics Geolocation Project

This is an mini project to demonstrate my ability to generate a Turtle Robot that can autonomously make it's way to a given location from anywhere on earth. Initial goal location is the Greenwhich Observatory.

**important things to remember:**
- this is about reboustness and structure of code rather than the actual number of features introduced.
- code cleanliness and readability is important


## Step 1: Create a realistic plan

### Part 1: Create some code for turtle to be able to directly move to the a given location.
- Get initial tutle onto a map
- Get initial motion abiliy

### Part 2: Introduce some ability to move across walking platforms???? google map api???? 
Idea 1: - Get path from google maps, implement PID to follow the line.


## Step 2: Create general methods


## Step 3: Create tests for given methods??????????????????????????????????
- checkout pytest and pyunit
